# Pitch Perfect Web App

Pitch Perfect is a web-based game inspired by the concept of an "immaculate grid," where players guess songs that multiple artists have collaborated on. This project demonstrates my skills in web development and integration with external APIs, specifically the Spotify API. Please note that this web app is not intended for public use but serves as a demonstration of my abilities.

## Getting Started

To use Pitch Perfect, you need to be granted access in development mode. Access is provided via email invitation. If you are an employer or potential collaborator interested in testing the web app, please reach out to me at [jpflynn01@gmail.com](mailto:jpflynn01@gmail.com).

## Features

- **Guess the Song:** Challenge yourself to identify songs that involve multiple artists.
- **Spotify Integration:** Pitch Perfect uses the Spotify API to fetch data about songs and artists.
- **Development Mode:** Access is restricted to authorized users during development.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## Project Structure

- `+page.svelte`: The home page which the user logs in on.
- `api/login/+server.js`: JS file that handles the login process.
- `callback/+page.svelte`: The callback page the user plays the game on.

## Usage

1. Email the developer to access Pitch Perfect in development mode.
2. Click on the provided link to access the web app.
3. Play the game like immaculate grid.

## Future Development

While Pitch Perfect is in development mode and not intended for public use, it can serve as a starting point for building a full-fledged game. Future enhancements may include:

- User account management.
- Multiplayer mode for friendly competition.
- Leaderboards and scoring system.
- Expanded song and artist database.
